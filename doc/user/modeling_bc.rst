Boundary conditions
-------------------

At this stage, HydroRoot has been developed to analyze experimental data done with pressure chamber for plant
in hydroponic solution. Therefore, the boundary conditions for the pressure are: uniform external hydrostatic pressure
surrounding the root, and atmospheric pressure at the base of the de-topped root.
